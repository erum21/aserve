<h2>Description</h2>
<div>AllegroServe has these components:<ul><li>HTTP/1.1 compliant web server capable of serving static and dynamic pages</li><li>HTML
generation facility that seamlessly merges html tag printing with
computation of dynamic content. The HTML generator matches perfectly
with the HTML parser (which is in another project) to allow web pages
to be read, modifed in Lisp and then regenerated.</li><li>HTTP client functions to access web sites and retrieve data.</li><li>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for both the server and client.</li><li>Web Proxy facility with a local cache.</li><li>Comprehensive regression test suite that verifies the functionality of the client, server, proxy and SSL</li><li>high performance for static and dynamic web page delivery</li><li>Licensed under terms that ensure that it will always be open source and that encourages its use in commercial settings.</li></ul><font color="green">We've recently added these features:<ul><li>A new publish function that builds a page from static and dynamic data and handles caching of the result.</li><li>Access
control mechanisms for publishing directories that gives the webmaster
the ability to specify which files and directories in the tree should
be visible.</li><li>The ability to run external CGI programs.</li><li>An improved virtual hosting system that supports different logging and error streams for each virtual host.</li></ul></font></div>

<h2>Author's Comments</h2>
<div>The server part of AllegroServe can be used either as a standalone
web server or a module loaded into an application to provide a user
interface to the application. AllegroServe's proxy ability allows it to
run on the gateway machine between a company's internal network and the
internet.AllegroServe's client functions allow Lisp programs to explore
the web.<p>AllegroServe was also written and open sourced as a way to demonstrate network programming in Allegro Common Lisp. </p><p>AllegroServe was written according to a certain <a href="http://www.franz.com/%7Ejkf/coding_standards.html">coding standard</a> to demonstrate how Lisp programs are more readable  if certain macros and special forms are avoided.</p></div>
<h2>Release History</h2>
<div>AllegroServe releases occur when significant new features or bug
fixes are made. The ChangeLog file that is part of the distribution
describes the changes in each release.<a href="http://github.com/franzinc/aserve/blob/d00a6f1cc646caab8fafea81142182f08432716a/ChangeLog">This</a> is a sample of a ChangeLog file but may not be the most up to date version of that file.</div>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<div>The links below may not point to the most up to date versions of
the documents referenced. The appropriate documentation for any version
of AllegroServe is found in the AllegroServe distribution.<ul><li>The <a href="aserve.html">AllegroServe Reference Manual</a> describes the client and server functions.</li><li>The <a href="tutorial.html">AllegroServe Tutorial</a> shows how easy it is to run AllegroServe and publish pages.</li><li>The <a href="htmlgen.html">HTML Generation manual</a> describes the language for generating HTML dynamically.</li></ul></div>

<h2>Platform</h2>
AllegroServe works on all versions of Allegro Common Lisp since 5.0.1.
<h2>Building</h2>
<div>The instructions for building AllegroServe from source are located in the README.md file that is part of the aserve distribution. </div>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
There are no dependences for AllegroServe.
<h2>Files</h2>
<div>AllegroServe is distributed as a gzipped tar file.  Windows users can use <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a> to recover the files from this type of archive. All releases of AllegroServe are found at <a href="ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/aserve/">ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/aserve/</a> and you'll likely want to choose the one with the highest version number.<p>git users can access the AllegroServe git respository using <a href="http://github.com/franzinc/aserve/tree/master">github's repository</a>
Using git allows you to make changes to the AllegroServe source in branches and
merged those changes into newer versions of AllegroServe.</p></div>
